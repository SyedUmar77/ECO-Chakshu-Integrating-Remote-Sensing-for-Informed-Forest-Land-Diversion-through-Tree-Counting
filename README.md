# Application-of-Image-Analytics-for-Tree-Enumeration-for-Diversion-of-Forest-Land
The main objective of this project, "ECO-CHAKSHU: Integrating Remote Sensing for Informed Forest Land Diversion through Tree Counting," is to develop a robust and automated system for detecting, classifying, and enumerating trees in forested areas using advanced image processing and deep learning techniques. By leveraging high-resolution satellite imagery and aerial photographs, the project aims to address the limitations of traditional tree enumeration methods, which are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inaccuracies. The system employs state-of-the-art technologies such as YOLOv8 and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately identify tree locations, classify species, and count the total number of trees within a given area. This information is crucial for informed decision-making regarding forest land diversion for developmental projects, ensuring sustainable management of forest resources while minimizing ecological impacts. Through this approach, the project aspires to contribute significantly to environmental conservation, forestry management, and land use planning.
